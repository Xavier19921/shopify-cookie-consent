# Shopify cookie consent
Cookie consent implementation for Shopify stores

The cookie consent implementation is built around <a href="https://cookieconsent.insites.com/">Insites' cookie consent</a>.

## Installation
1. Add cookie-consent.liquid to your theme's sections.
2. Include cookie-consent.liquid in your theme.liquid. Ideal placement is right before the closing of your body tag.
3. Translate language strings in your theme language.
4. Use the theme customizer in your Shopify store backend to style and enable the section.
