# Shopify cookie consent
Cookie consent implementation for Shopify stores

The cookie consent implementation is built around <a href="https://cookieconsent.insites.com/">Insites' cookie consent</a>.

## Installation

2. Include cookie-consent.liquid in your theme.liquid. Ideal placement is right before the closing of your <body> tag.
3. Add settings-schema.json to your theme's existing settings-schema.json file.
